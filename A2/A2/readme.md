Pathfinder Hexadecimal Translation
    
    Overview:using the adaptation of “The Martian” a pathfinder from which we could publish (angles) on a servomotor and 
    display on an LCD.


I.	INTRODUCTION

For the communication we were to use a servomotor at pin 9, so we could exactly point at the 16 hex characters using 
180 degrees equally (0 - F). We had to use an MQTT client to communicate with the server (thor.csce.uark.edu). 
The angles were to be published on “uark/csce5013/username/angles” and the messages to the LCD “uark/csce5013/username/lcd”.

II.	APPLICATION DESIGN
Building up the Arduino.
